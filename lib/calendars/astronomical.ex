  Documentation for the Astronomical calendar.

  From [Wikipedia, 2020-07-24](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_year_numbering):

  > Astronomical year numbering is based on AD/CE year numbering,
  > but follows normal decimal integer numbering more strictly.
  > Thus, it has a year 0; the years before that are designated
  > with negative numbers and the years after that are designated
  > with positive numbers. Astronomers use the Julian calendar for
  > years before 1582, including the year 0, and the Gregorian calendar
  > for years after 1582, as exemplified by Jacques Cassini (1740),
  > Simon Newcomb (1898) and Fred Espenak (2007).

  This calendar will be implemented in the future.
